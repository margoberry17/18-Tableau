1. How many trips have been recorded in total during the months of 2023 for members and non-members?
   
In 2023, bike use varies from month to month, with the lowest number of rides (51.2K) in February and the highest number of rides (112K) in August. For casual riders though, July was the month with the highest number of rides (33.2K). Summer (June, July, & August), has the highest number of rides compared to any other seson, where winter (December, January, & February) has the least amount of rides. This makes sense since people tend to be outside more in the summer time compared to staying in during the winter. Members make up 74% of the rides.

2. In 2023, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting and ending a journey?

The top 10 stations where people start their rides is nearly the same as the top 10 stations where people end thier rides. This makes sense since I'd imagine most people return the bikes at their original destination. Grove St.(~50K), Hoboken Terminal (43K), and S. Waterfront Walkway (31K) were the top three most popular stations.

3. In 2023, what are the most popular stations in the city for starting and ending a journey visually shown on a map?

In the map, the locations are sorted in order of popularity from highest to lowest and can also be seen by the size of their circle. You can toggle to see just one station at a time.

4. In 2023, what are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months and winter months?

In 2023, the Summer Peak Hours show a slight spike from 8-9 am with 19K rides and a larger spike from the hours of 5-7 pm with ~30K rides per hour. Similarly, for the Winter Peak Hours there is a slight spike from 8-9 am with 11.8K rides and larger spike from 5-7 pm with 15K rides per hour. This makes sense since these are commuting hours for work. This also shows how winter rides are about half the amount compared to the number of summer rides.

5. In 2023, what are the peak start times by weekday?

This shows a similar story as the peak hours in the summer and winter months with more rides happening during working commuting hours. Monday-Friday from 7-9 am and from 5-8 pm are showing up darker representing higher volume in the number of rides. It looks like Tuesday's from 6-7 pm is the most popular time and day of the week with 17K rides.
